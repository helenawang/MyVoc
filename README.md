# MyVoc
###a iciba-like dictionary application, integrated Collins dictionary API
##7.26 update
* the "word of the day" button is ok now. Enjoy~
* It was some problems of the format of the url, hence I modified this part of the library "SkPublishAPI" and upload it as well(in lib/).

##7.22 update
* the "add to notebook" button will add the entry both to a .txt file and to your local database.
* but the defination and examples are mixed, I need to learn more about DOM to extract them properly and make them aligned.

p.s the font under my ubuntu is so ugly now...
###for each word you looked up, this program can:
* show the search result from `COBUILD Advanced British English Dictionary`
* add the word to notebook and your local database if you click the `add to notebook` button
* extract the definition and examples to a `word.txt` file

###And I will try to add some custom funtions in order to track behaviours and help you with your English learning~
###Thanks Collins Learning for providing API key and all the helpful documents.
###I also got the API key of Merriam-Webster's dictionary, I will try to integrate it next time.
