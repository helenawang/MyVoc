###for each word you looked up, this program can:
* show the search result from `COBUILD Advanced British English Dictionary`
* add the word to notebook if you click the `add to notebook` button
* extract the definition and examples to a `word.txt` file

###Next I will try to add some custom funtions in order to track behaviours and help you with your English learning~
