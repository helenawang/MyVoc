# MyVoc
a iciba-like dictionary application, integrated Collins dictionary API

for each word you looked up, this program can:
1. show the search result from "COBUILD Advanced British English Dictionary"
2. add the word to notebook if you click the "add to notebook" button
3. extract the definition and examples to a .txt file

I will try to add some custom funtions in order to track behaviours and help you learn English~
