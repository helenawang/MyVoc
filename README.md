###a iciba-like dictionary application, integrated Collins dictionary API
7.15 update
* when you launch a search, it will first look up your local database, if not found, then it will refer to the Online Dictionary
* the "word of the day" button still can not be used, I've got some problems in the request method, which I will check with the API provider.

###for each word you looked up, this program can:
* show the search result from `COBUILD Advanced British English Dictionary`
* add the word to notebook if you click the `add to notebook` button
* extract the definition and examples to a `word.txt` file

###Next I will try to add some custom funtions in order to track behaviours and help you with your English learning~
###Thanks Collins Learning for providing API key and all the helpful documents.
